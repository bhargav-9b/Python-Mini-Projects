# 🧠 Python Mini Projects – OOP Based Simulations

This repository contains a collection of Python-based Jupyter Notebook projects that simulate real-world systems using object-oriented programming concepts.

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🏧 ATM Machine
**File:** `ATM Machine.ipynb`  
Simulates a simple ATM interface allowing users to:
- Check balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw cash
- Exit the session

> 💡 Great for understanding user input, condition handling, and class-based account logic.

### 2. 🎟️ BookMyShow Ticket Booking
**File:** `Bookmyshow.ipynb`  
A simplified version of the BookMyShow platform that includes:
- Seat selection and booking
- Show listing
- Ticket management

> 💡 Demonstrates nested data structures, exception handling, and user interaction logic.

### 3. 🛗 Elevator System
**File:** `Elevatorsystem.ipynb`  
Simulates an elevator's behavior including:
- Floor requests
- Moving up/down logic
- Handling multiple requests

> 💡 Covers real-time system logic, queue management, and OOP design patterns.

### 4. 🚗 Parking Lot Management
**File:** `Parkinglot.ipynb`  
Models a parking lot system with features like:
- Vehicle entry and exit
- Slot allocation
- Parking status

> 💡 Ideal for understanding class interaction, storage design, and simulation flows.
